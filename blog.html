      <h2>My review on the new M1 MacBook Pros</h2>
      <p>Hello everyone! Welcome to my review of the M1 MacBook pro. I recently got this as my new computer, and it has been amazing till now. 
</p>
<p>
        Originally released in September 2020, this MacBook pro almost lives up to what Apple said in their September event. Along with the MacBook Pro, a MacBook Air and Mac mini was released, with the apple silicon chip. Apple has claimed that the laptop has 5 times better graphics performance, 11 times faster machine learning performance, 20-hour battery life, and a much faster SSD. After using my MacBook pro for almost a month now, I am ready to give an accurate review (as best as I can).

        Even though I am not much of a gamer, (I only play Minecraft) GPU does seem better than other macs GPUs. When I play Minecraft 1.8, when I am playing on the Hypixel server, I usually get around 200 fps. This is when I use Lunar Client for apple silicon though. With the normal launcher, I get 100 to 150 fps. When I play 1.16, I play on the normal Minecraft launcher. This gives me around 60 to 80 fps. Even with Sildur's Enhanced Default shaders, I get 70 frames, consistently. So, for my needs, the GPU is great.

        As for apple’s claims on apps opening instantly, it isn’t exactly true. With my experience, apps made by Apple, such as safari, system preferences and more do open instantly, but other apps don’t. I’m not saying that they open slowly, but it isn’t the same as instant.

        The new MacBook Pro design is also thicker, with the magic keyboard. The thickness is actually noticeable, but the weight doesn’t feel like it is too much. The magic keyboard is great, although the butterfly keyboard has a better typing experience as the key repeat is less and the sound is better. However, I would pick durability first as the butterfly keyboard is known for being unreliable.

        Overall, the new M1 MacBook Pro is much better than the intel models and I would strongly recommend getting this new version. At the moment though, the M1 processor only supports up to 16 GB of ram and 2 terabytes of SSD. Even though my Mac only has 8 GB of ram, I’ve barely even hit 7 GB used even with multiple apps open. The chip also only supports two USB type C ports at the moment. Unless you need extra storage built-in or require more than 16 GB of ram, the M1 MacBook Pro is the best laptop of 2021. Of course, some apps are not supported on M1, but support is coming soon. Even when apps aren’t made for apple silicon, they still can open, and performance is barely affected. Some apps like blue stacks don’t work on apple silicon, but as I said, support is coming soon.
